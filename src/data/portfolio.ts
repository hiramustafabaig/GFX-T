/**
 * Portfolio exhibition data.
 *
 * Current pieces are the samples on the "Our Portfolio" page of the GFX-T company profile (PDF).
 * They are low-resolution crops, so the UI shows them at thumbnail scale. Nothing is invented:
 *  - a post names a client only when that client's wordmark is visible in the artwork AND the
 *    client is on the official list (data/clients.ts); otherwise no client is shown;
 *  - brand identities are titled with the name written in the mark itself.
 *
 * To add or upgrade work: put originals in `assets-src/portfolio/<slug>/`, run `npm run images`,
 * and add/update the entry below (width/height as printed by the script).
